traceroute ip address of myserver to check if can get to it via icmp
	if result is positive:
		checking dns resolving (in case i'm using FQDN for connecting to the server)
			if DNS resolves the name
				checking local firewall on PC (if there is any)
				checking firewall access list on my local router
        check firewall setting on remote server if there is any possibility
			else 
				checking local DNS setting on local PC

	if trace passes my local router:
    but can not get destination host - Call to ISP (double check firewall setting on remote server if there is any possibility)
 
  if trace does not pass router:
		checking gateway configuration on PC
		checking if router can communicate with next hop IP
		checking physical conectivity
